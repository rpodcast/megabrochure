# megabrochure

This repo contains an early prototype of a Shiny application that is built with both the [`{golem}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) and [`{brochure}`](https://github.com/ColinFay/brochure) packages to create a native multi-page Shiny app as a package. Expect many changes and debugging artifacts as I continue this learning journey!
